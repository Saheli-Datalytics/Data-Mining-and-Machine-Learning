# Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning
This house rent prediction project compares machine learning techniques (decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost) on three datasets for housing price/rent prediction. It addresses two questions: 1) Do different implementations of the same technique yield different results? 2) How do dataset characteristics impact performance? Results show variation based on dataset and metrics, with consistent best performers in each library. Datasets differ significantly in features, size, and distribution, requiring feature engineering for fair comparisons. This project provides insights into effective machine-learning techniques for housing prediction, emphasizing the role of dataset characteristics in modeling.
